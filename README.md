# SnowBall Warfare
A game I made for my major project in Year 12 Software Design and Development. It was my first foray into programming and it was really fun to make, learning all the in and outs of the logic you had to use to implement everything. It is implemented completely in JavaScript on the client side, with canvas the HTML5 graphics API.  It's a physics based game that's used with your mouse to throw projectiles. 

# Run it yourself
Just clone and open index.html! In the classic days before transpiling JS became a thing.
